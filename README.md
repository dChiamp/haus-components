_NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY A BIG WORK IN PROGRESS_

Reusable components and directives for Vue. Designed for [Stackhaus](https://github.com/funkhaus/stackhaus) - a Graph QL powered frontend tech stack built on Nuxt, using Apollo.

`haus-components` saves you the trouble of rewriting common components like images, video players, svgs, and several other elements. If you're looking at writing a custom component, check if one already exists here first - and if it doesn't, feel free to [contribute](#contributing)!

## TODO list

TODO improvements:

1.  Improve documentation
1.  Add Storybook UI to this
1.  Make this an NPM module?
1.  The slideshow-list component on MPC is the base of a really good background slideshow. Add that to this. Need to make it more generic, with slots probably.
1.  Get ESLINT working on this repo. Spacing is all wrong.
1.  Make WP Menu more robust. Probabley needs a `wp-menu-item` and to work with external links.
